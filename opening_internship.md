# Technical and commercial feasibility of imaging  of RF leakage in quantum chips (Internship, 3-6 months) 
**Develop new diagnostic tools that will enable the quantum revolution at a fast-growing startup**

Quantum computing will allow it to tackle problems that are currently impossible to solve. But quantum chips are complex and when they do not work as well as they should (and they often don’t), there is no way to find out why, which component failed, and how to improve the production processes. This is one of the major road-blocks towards scaling quantum chips. QuantaMap’s novel microscope, based on SQUID-on-tip, will provide a solution to this problem and help enable the quantum revolution.
In this internship, you will evaluate the feasibility of a new imaging method for RF fields that relies on SQUID signals. This includes both the technical feasibility as well as quantifying how large of a business opportunity this presents. You will simulate and analyze imaging data to quantify the obtainable imaging quality. Additionally, you will support our CEO by preparing, performing and evaluating structured interviews with potential customers of this new technology to quantify the business opportunity. 
You will become a key part of our small, but fast-growing company, and you will join us during a very exciting time: We recently acquired funding, which allows us to accelerate and grow our team. 

## Impact of the role:
Our company is developing one-of-its-kind technology that can solve one of the most important problems in the quantum industry. You will join the team developing this technology, and your talent and hard work will have an impact on the quantum industry as a whole. You will be part of a small, dynamic team, where we help each other to thrive, and work towards our common goals. We believe in giving ownership and responsibility in this task to all team members. 

## Internship requirements
To be successful in this internship, you at least have the following: 
*	a relevant Master in physics, engineering, data science or similar and interest to take a deep dive into market evaluation and structured customer interviews 
* 	OR a background in business and interest to take a deep dive into the physics and data analytics of a complex imaging method
*	experience with data analysis in python
*	appetite to take responsibility and make an impact
*	passion and perseverance
* 	excellent communication skills 
*	availability for 3-6 months (the longer the better)

This role requires you to be an independent problem solver, to make things work, to have grit and a passion for customers. You have to be a great team player who wants the success of the team. It is important that you act with integrity and thrive in the uncertain and dynamic scale-up environment. 

Please do not hesitate to apply if you think this could be the right opportunity for you, even if you do not tick all of the boxes. 

## What we have to offer 
We offer you a challenging position, a competitive, monthly internship compensation and ample opportunity to shape the impact that you make during your time at QuantaMap. 

As a hardware-centered startup we think it a strength to be in the lab together, but for this role we can consider remote work.

You will join a team of four founders and two interns who are extremely motivated to solve hard problems that do not have solutions yet. We believe that our technology will have major impact in the quantum industry and will have applications in different fields in science and emerging technology as well. You will contribute to this revolution and get to work with world-leading experts within a field that is on top of the strategic agendas of the world’s most innovative nations and to collaborate with the world’s leading quantum chip producers. At Quantamap, we are committed to diversity and to creating an open and inclusive environment where everyone can speak up, learn and thrive. We value mentorship, trust, kindness, and ambition.  

## How to apply
Please send us your CV and a short message why you want to join QuantaMap to [join-us@quantamap.nl](mailto:join-us@quantamap.nl) and we will come back to you with suggestions for a date of a first interview.

In case you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to our CEO, Johannes Jobst ([johannes@quantamap.nl](mailto:johannes@quantamap.nl), +31649588920).
