At Quantamap, we are developing cutting-edge tools for metrology and defect inspection for quantum chips and other quantum hardware.

We are convinced that one of the major road-blocks of quantum computing is that when chips do not work as well as they should (they often don't), there is no way to find out why, which component failed, and how to improve the production processes. Our novel microscope, based on SQUID-on-tip, will solve this and help enable the quantum revolution.

We are team of four founders and two interns and are extremely motivated to solve hard problems that do not have solutions yet. We believe that our technology will have major impact in the quantum industry and will have applications in different fields in science and emerging technology as well. At QuantaMap, we are committed to diversity and work to build an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.
