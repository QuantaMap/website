# Quantum Microscope Designer
**Develop new diagnostic tools that will enable the quantum revolution at a fast-growing startup**

Quantum computing will allow it to tackle problems that are currently impossible to solve. But quantum chips are complex and when they do not work as well as they should (and they often don’t), there is no way to find out why, which component failed, and how to improve the production processes. This is one of the major road-blocks towards scaling quantum chips. QuantaMap’s novel microscope, based on SQUID-on-tip, will provide a solution to this problem and help enable the quantum revolution.
As a Quantum Microscope Designer you will play a crucial role in the development and market introduction of our technologies. You will become a key part of our small, but fast-growing company, and you will join us during a very exciting time: We recently acquired funding, which allows us to accelerate and grow our team. Your main responsibilities will be technical, but because of the early stage of the company, we explicitly welcome applicants with interest in leadership and management responsibilities.

## Impact of the role:
Our company is developing one-of-its-kind technology that can solve one of the most important problems in the quantum industry. You will be a key member of the team developing this technology, and your talent and hard work will have an impact on the quantum industry as a whole. You will be part of a small, dynamic team, where we help each other to thrive, and work towards our common goals. We believe in giving ownership and responsibility in this task to all team members. 

## Job requirements
To be successful as a Quantum Microscope Designer, you at least have the following: 
*	a relevant Master in physics or engineering
*	experience gained within a (hardware-centered) research and development or production environment, or a PhD in that area
*	appetite to take responsibility and make an impact
*	passion and perseverance
  
The match would be even more perfect if you have:
*	hands-on experience in atomic force microscopy or cryogenics
*	knowledge of electronics and circuit design
*	experience in instrument design
*	experience in scaling up a business
*	interest in business and organization

This role requires you to be an independent problem solver, to make things work, to have grit and a passion for building things. You have to be a great team player who wants the success of the team. It is important that you act with integrity and thrive in the uncertain and dynamic scale-up environment. 

Please do not hesitate to apply if you think this could be the right opportunity for you, even if you do not tick all of the boxes. 

## What we have to offer 
We offer you a challenging position with ample opportunity to grow. You join a growing company, so you can have a key role in shaping the company early on. Depending on the candidate, we can also offer equity benefits. 
We are team of four founders and two interns and are extremely motivated to solve hard problems that do not have solutions yet. We believe that our technology will have major impact in the quantum industry and will have applications in different fields in science and emerging technology as well. You can join this team and get to work with world-leading experts within a field that is on top of the strategic agendas of the world’s most innovative nations and to collaborate with the world’s leading quantum chip producers. At Quantamap, we are committed to diversity and to creating an open and inclusive environment where everyone can speak up, learn and thrive. We value mentorship, trust, kindness, and ambition.  

## How to apply
Please send us your CV and a short message why you want to join QuantaMap to [join-us@quantamap.nl](mailto:join-us@quantamap.nl) and we will come back to you with suggestions for a date of a first interview.

In case you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to our CEO, Johannes Jobst ([johannes@quantamap.nl](mailto:johannes@quantamap.nl), +31649588920).
