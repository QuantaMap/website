Our team is motivated to solve hard problems that do not have solutions yet. We believe that our technology will have a major impact on the quantum industry, and will also have applications in different fields in science and emerging technology. We are a team of eight nationalities and are committed to diversity and work to build an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.

# Our mission and our technology

At Quantamap, we are developing cutting-edge tools for metrology and defect inspection for quantum chips and other quantum hardware.

We concluded that one of the major road-blocks of quantum computing is that when chips do not work as well as they should (they often donâ€™t), there is no way to find out which component failed, and how to improve the production processes. 

We believe that our novel microscope, based on SQUID-on-tip, can solve the diagnostics challenge and help enable the quantum revolution.
