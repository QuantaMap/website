We are motivated to solve hard problems that do not have solutions yet as a team. We believe that our technology will have a major impact on the quantum industry, and will also have applications in different fields in science and emerging technology. We are committed to diversity and work to build an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.

# Our mission and our technology

At Quantamap, we are developing cutting-edge tools for metrology and defect inspection for quantum chips and other quantum hardware.

We concluded that one of the major road-blocks of quantum computing is that when chips do not work as well as they should (they often donâ€™t), there is no way to find out which component failed, and how to improve the production processes. 

We believe that our novel microscope, based on SQUID-on-tip, can solve the diagnostics challenge and help enable the quantum revolution.
